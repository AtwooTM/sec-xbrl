XBRL.US Webinar: How to download and process SEC XBRL Data Directly from EDGAR

These are the supporting files for the XBRL.US Webinar that is availble
on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Oe9ZqXVGME as well as the slides
available here on SlideShare: http://www.slideshare.net/afalk42/xbrl-us-altova-webinar

To use these files you will need to download and install RaptorXML+XBRL Server from
the Altova website: http://www.altova.com/download-trial-server.html and then 
request a 30-day free evaluation license key.

These sample Python scripts available here on GitHub were tested with a the MacOS
version of RaptorXML+XBRL Server, but should function with the Windows or Linux version
as well. You may need to change the file-paths pointing to the RaptorXML+XBRL Server
executable in the Python script, though.

For more information on RaptorXML, please see here: http://www.altova.com/raptorxml.html
